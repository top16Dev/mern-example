# MERN stack starter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rfdickerson/mern-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rfdickerson/mern-example)

The MERN stack starter demonstrates a working application that uses a React frontend, with a backend build with ExpressJS and MongoDB. It shows how the client can make client HTTP requests and maintain persistant sessions. 

## Getting Started

To run a development environment, you can use the `start-dev` command. This will start up a development web server on port 3000, and a nodemon-watched API server on port 3100. These development servers will automatically reload if changes are made to the source.

  - Install dependencies with:

    ```
    yarn
    ```
  
  - Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)
   
  - Start the development environment:

    ```
    yarn start-dev
    ```

## Docker Compose

  If you use Docker and Docker Compose, you can start the entire project with:

  ```
  docker-compose up
  ```
 
## Configuration (Optional)

By default, the server will expect to connect to a MongoDB instance running on localhost:27017. However, you can customize the environment to use different values for the MongoDB host. To do that, you can create a `.env` file for specifying credential information for MongoDB. 

Create a new file called `.env`, with the following YAML:

```yaml
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/comments
MONGO_USER=username
MONGO_PASSWORD=password
```

or instead, you can use the equivalent JSON:

```json
{
  "mongo": {
    "url": "mongodb://localhost:27017/comments",
    "user": "username",
    "password": "password"
  }
}
```

Where the URL, username, and password are set to your preferences.

## Docker Development run

If you would like to run the development tools inside of a docker container, you can set up a local Docker development environment by building the image:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile-tools -t rfdickerson/mern-example .
```

And running the image:

```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/usr/app -p 3000:3100 -t rfdickerson/mern-example
```
